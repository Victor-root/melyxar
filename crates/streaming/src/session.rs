//! One film being watched: a folder, a tool, and segments on demand.
//!
//! A session is asked for a segment by number. Three things can be true. The
//! segment is already on disk, and it is handed over. The tool is running and
//! about to reach it, so waiting a moment is cheaper than starting again.
//! Or it is somewhere else entirely, which is what a viewer dragging the
//! cursor looks like: the tool is stopped and started again at that point.
//!
//! That third case is the whole reason the server owns the playlist. Nothing
//! about jumping is special here; it is the ordinary path with a different
//! number.
